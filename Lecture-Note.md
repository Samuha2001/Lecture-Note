# Balancing function and fashion
**Balancing function and fashion means finding clothes that work for both your lifestyle and your sense of style. It's about feeling confident and comfortable, no matter what you're doing.**

**Here are some tips to help you strike the perfect balance**

   <sup> For example think about where you're going. Are you going to work, meeting friends, or going outdoors? Different places need different kinds of clothes that are both practical and look good.
    Wear clothes that fit you well. Clothes that are too tight or too loose can be uncomfortable and not look nice. Clothes that fit well will make you look good and feel better about yourself.
    Buy good-quality clothes. They last longer, look better, and feel more comfortable than cheap clothes.
    Try different styles. Fashion is all about trying new things! See what you like and what looks good on you.
    Use accessories. They can make your outfit more personal and make you look even better.</sup>
